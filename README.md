I built a calculator for finding the GCD and LCM using Python. Using this application you can get GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM(Least Common Multiple) values â€‹â€‹of any 2 integers. This can be very useful for students studying mathematics. But to develop their mathematical abilities, they should solve mathematics problems by themselves. I think it would be better if such applications were used for rechecking answers ðŸš€.
